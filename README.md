# Sunny rehabilitation Resort 
# Business description 
My name is Ivan Glad and I’m the owner of the „Sunny rehabilitation Resort”. We are a small company that has under 100 employees. 
As the name of our company states, we try to combine rehabilitation with holidays. Therefore we use the word „resort“ instead of center. 
Our target demographic is people above the age of 50, however, everyone is welcome to book a stay at our center. We are currently 
in possession of 4 different resorts but will be looking to expand in the future as our company will grow. These places are small 
but we pride ourselves on the number of types of rehabilitations that we offer and our skillful employees. Since our resorts are 
placed in the beautiful: 1. Hooksiel 2. Göhren 3. Bansin 4. Schmallenberg. Our customers can, not only restore, improve or maintain 
their mobility, independence, and physical health but also use the time spent at our resort as a vacation to restore their inner peace 
and gain more energy for their everyday life. Each center has a different offer of rehabilitation based on the crew of workers stationing 
there, so before booking make sure to contact our staff and make sure that the location of your choosing has everything that you need.

# Application
# Why do we need the app
We are in need of an application for our „Sunny rehabilitation Resort“. We have noticed that managing on the go seems quite impossible for us.
Since we aim to grow our company, we attend many events to promote our resort. However since we have gained our 3rd and 4th location and we are 
not able to bring our managing systems set ups with us to those gatherings, the viewing of the different rehabilitation types, as well as our 
offers at different locations, has been very difficult. Therefore we ask you to develop an app for us that would help us to manage our locations, 
workers, and rehabilitation offers. We want our emplyees to be able to acess those informations at any point and at any location just by using 
the app on their phone

# The name and the domain of the app

We have used this page https://www.name.com/domain/search to check if the name of our domain would be available and here you can see that 
the "sunnyRehabResort.com is not yet taken. We want our app to have the same name as the one listed on the picture.




# Tasks that this app shoul allow us to do:

The goal for this app would be to allow our workers to:
-	View the location information: city, workers assigned to this location, rehabilitation types available at this resort. 
-	View the list of rehabilitation types that we offer: name 
-	Add a new employee to the employee database: Employee Id, legal name, set of skills = rehabilitation types that they support.
-	Update an existing employee data in case they acquire a new set of skill or change their name
-	Remove an employee if needed
-	add a new location when our company will grow
-	assign a new crew to a location or add or remove a single emplyee from the cast
-
